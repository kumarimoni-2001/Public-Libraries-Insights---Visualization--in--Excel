# Public-Libraries-Insights---Visualization--in--Excel

**1. Project Overview**
**Objective**

The Public Libraries Data Analysis Project aims to analyze the distribution, accessibility, and funding of public libraries using Excel-based data visualization and dashboards. The goal is to help policymakers and researchers optimize library resources, services, and future planning based on data insights.

**Goals**

Analyze trends in library locations, accessibility, and funding allocation.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Excel.

Create interactive pie charts, bar charts, and dashboards.

Identify correlations between funding and library usage.

Provide actionable recommendations for improving library accessibility.

**Expected Outcomes**

A clean dataset prepared for Excel analysis.

Key insights into public library funding, accessibility, and distribution.

Visual dashboards with pie charts, bar charts, and heatmaps.

Recommendations for policymakers and researchers.

**2. Module-Wise Breakdown**

**Module 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

**Purpose:** Ensure data consistency, remove missing values, and standardize formats.

Load and inspect the dataset in Excel.

Handle missing, inconsistent, or duplicate data.

Format library names, locations, and funding categories correctly.

Save the cleaned dataset for analysis.

**Module 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Statistical Insights**

**Purpose:** Extract key trends from the dataset using Excel functions & PivotTables.

Compute summary statistics (mean, median, variance).

Analyze distributions of libraries per region, funding allocations, services.

Identify trends & correlations between population and library services.

**Techniques Used:**

**PivotTables & PivotCharts for quick insights.**

**Conditional Formatting to highlight key metrics.**

**Excel Formulas (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNTIF, VLOOKUP) for calculations.**

**Module 3: Data Visualization & Dashboard Creation**

**Purpose:** Develop interactive visualizations for decision-making.

**Pie Chart:** Funding allocations across regions.

**Bar Chart:** Number of libraries per region.

**Line Chart:** Trends in library visits over the years.

**Heatmap:** Funding distribution across locations.

**Interactive Dashboard:** Use Excel slicers and filters for real-time data exploration.

**Techniques Used:**

**Excel Charts (Pie, Bar, Line, Heatmaps) for insights.**

**Slicers & Filters for interactivity.**

**Data Validation Dropdowns for category selection.**

**Module 4: Insights & Recommendations**

**Purpose:** Use Excel data analysis to generate meaningful insights.

Identify underfunded regions with low library access.

Predict high-demand areas for new libraries.

Recommend policy changes for better funding allocation.

Present findings in an Excel Dashboard Report.

**Techniques Used:**

IF Statements for decision-based recommendations.

Excel Forecasting Tools to predict future trends.

**3. Execution Plan**

**Phase 1: Data Collection & Cleaning**
Load dataset in Excel.

Handle missing values and standardize format.

**Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis**
Generate PivotTables for insights.

Identify trends and correlations.

**Phase 3: Data Visualization**
Create pie charts, bar graphs, heatmaps, dashboards.

Implement interactive Excel slicers & filters.

**Phase 4: Insights & Recommendations**
